# ERAS-ReadMe

Welcome to my GitHub! I've uploaded projects here that span my undergraduate and medical school extracurricular time. They were done purely for fun or out of curiosity. GitHub is a cloud-based platform for programming organization; I began consolidating some code here for one project and decided to upload other projects unrelated to coding. This list with upload status includes:

Audio Localization - Uploaded
Model Kayak - Uploaded
Second Monitor - To upload
CPU cooler - To upload
